## Lessons Learned


While working on the Dog Rescue Ranch App, I have been learning how to create my project using Angular for my client side functionality. I am seeing how to use components, services, modules, data binding, and routing. For my back-end framework I used Spring Boot with which I am learning how to use dependency injections. In my Angular components and services I use HTTP reuqests to interact with data in my Database. In my Spring Boot project I access my DB data to perform CRUD operations and inject those dependencies into my Contollers and Services to achieve my desired results.



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
